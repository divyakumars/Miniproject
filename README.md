#### Output1 - LOGIN PAGE


The Login Page in the Exam Slot Booking System is a secure access point designed to authenticate both students and admins, directing each to their respective dashboards. This page features fields for username and password entry, with robust security measures in place, including password encryption and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management. Upon login, admins gain access to a dashboard where they can oversee and manage room assignments, adjust exam slots, and monitor booking activity. Students, on the other hand, are directed to their booking interface, where they can view available exam slots, make reservations, and manage their bookings, ensuring a streamlined and user-friendly experience for both roles.
